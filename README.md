# Stokesian_dynamics
# It is a numerical method that solves the equations of motion for a system of particles in a fluid.
# The equations of motion are based on the Stokes equations, which describe the motion of a fluid in the low Reynolds number regime.
# Stokesian Dynamics is a versatile method that can be used to simulate a wide variety of systems, including suspensions of particles, emulsions, and foams.
# It is a relatively computationally expensive method, but it is more accurate than other methods, such as Brownian dynamics.
