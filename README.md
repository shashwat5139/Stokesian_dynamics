# Stokesian_dynamics
### It is a numerical method that solves the equations of motion for a system of particles in a fluid.
### The equations of motion are based on the Stokes equations, which describe the motion of a fluid in the low Reynolds number regime.
### Stokesian Dynamics is a versatile method that can simulate various systems, including suspensions of particles, emulsions, and foams.
### It is a relatively computationally expensive method but more accurate than other methods, such as Brownian dynamics.
